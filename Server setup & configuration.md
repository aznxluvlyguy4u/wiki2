# Server setup & configuration

## EC2 Image

When needed, we've setup two base AMI's (EC2 images), for both _staging & production_.
These two images are already prepared and configured, only step that is needed, to get the react webapp working, is spinning up node. 

- See here for the AMI's: https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Images:sort=name

- See the [deploy instructions](Remote%20deploying)
